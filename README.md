## General Info
The **Mobile Automated Drone Liftoff Airborne Delivery Service (MADLADS)** is a drone delivery system designed for professional use. The drone can be piloted manually with a custom controller or can operate autonomously. It features a camera lens for packagae identification and  a claw mechanism for acquisition and dropoff.

**MADLADS** is inspired by *Amazon Prime Air*. Amazonâ€™s CEO, Jeff Bezos, first proposed a drone delivery service in 2013. Although initially met with heavy criticism, Amazon continued developing the service and has patented a beehive-like structure to store and charge delivery drones in cities. In 2016, *Amazon Prime Air* completed its first delivery to Cambridge, England. Drones may very well become the new standard for fast, secure, and reliable deliveries.<sup>[2]</sup>
